\section{Conclusion}

The present paper discussed some first impressions on the possible motivations which drive community network activists of the Germany based project Freifunk.
Although the sample of interviewees was fairly small (16 people) and the employed methodology may lack some scientific thoroughness, some interesting patterns have emerged.

Further investigations with improved methods and including a larger participants' sample from different community network projects would definitely be insightful, since every project has its own specific characteristics and priorities.

* an investigation of further community network projects would definitely be insightful, since all of them have sometimes quite different aspects, ideas, definitions, motivations

* not clear whether such a comparison is really valid: methods for gathering results in both domains vary widely

* Die Papers beschäftigen sich (vor allem) mit der Motivation von Entwickler*innen. Allerdings gibt es auch andere Möglichkeiten zu beiden Communities beizutragen (user documentation, publicity, design, Übersetzung, ...). Kann man sich da andere Motivationen vorstellen?

* critical discussion of the own methodology

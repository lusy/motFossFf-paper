\section{Methodology}

Due to the gap in the scientific literature on motivation in community network projects, primary field research in the form of semi-structured interviews was conducted.
The questions for the interviews were inspired by the questionnaires applied by scientists investigating the FOSS motivations\cite{HarOu2002}\cite{LakWo2005} and complemented by questions the author considered relevant/insightful. %TODO: include questions if there's space
The interviews were conducted in person (all but one of them, which was conducted using a common voip software) and were not recorded and transcribed, but instead, foundation for the present paper form the extensive notes taken by the author. % is "I" frowned upon?
The author is well aware of the limitations such approach poses, nevertheless, it was considered a quick and useful way to gain some first impressions onthe wide variety of reasons which spur community network activists.

The interviews were conducted over a period of two months in the beginnings of 2016.
Some demographic information about the participants is summarised in figure X.

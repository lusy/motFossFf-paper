%\section{Abstract}
\begin{abstract}
  Motivation of free and open source software developers has been widely studied over the years.
  The reasons people engage in this seemingly altruistic behavior have been elaborated and classified.
  The present work addresses a slightly different issue:
  what motivates people/activists/individuals/actors/syn to participate in community network projects?
  Based on the established/syn FOSS motivation research and newly/currently/freshly/syn conducted interviews with community network activists from the Germany based project Freifunk, we will compare and contrast the specifics of both domains and the factors which spur their members to action.
  %TODO: add findings?

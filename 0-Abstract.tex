%\section{Abstract}
\begin{abstract}
  Motivation of free and open source software developers has been widely studied over the years.
  The reasons people engage in this seemingly altruistic behavior have been elaborated and classified.
  The present work addresses a slightly different issue:
  what motivates individuals to participate in community/free network projects? %people/activists/individuals/actors
  %TODO: decide whether free/community networks should be used synonymously
  Are the reasons similar to or quite distinct from these relevant to contributors to free software?
  Based on recently conducted interviews with community network activists from the Germany based project Freifunk and established FOSS motivation research, we will compare and contrast the specifics of both domains and the factors which spur their members to action.
  %TODO: add findings?

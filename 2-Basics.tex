What is FOSS (really brief, people should know that)
What is Freifunk (slightly less brief, is the new community) <--- that's the focus

Comparison of the domains:
* FOSS: digital products
* community networks:
  ** digital products (the firmware)
  ** hardware costs
  ** network maintanance
  ** network installation on site
  ** talk to people and convince them of the idea in order to
     *** get access to suitable locaitions
     *** get funds
     *** convince them to install their own routers and extend the network -- ``marketing'' aspect a way more pronounced

What types of motivation are relevant
